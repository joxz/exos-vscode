# ExtremeXOS Language Settings for Visual Studio Code


## Colorization rules for ExtremeXOS configuration files
Colors for several keywords (configure, create, add, delete, enable, disable, IP addresses, Portranges,...)

## Snippets which I use quite a lot:
* Create VLAN
* LLDP MED config
* Create SNMPv3 user
* Add port to VLAN tagged or untagged
* Delete port from VLAN
* RADIUS server and shared secret config
* Add port description



## Install this extension
